- **Age:** 32
- **Role:** Primary caregiver, working professional
- **Tech Comfort:** Low to Moderate

## Goals

- Track feeding schedules to ensure baby is eating enough
- Monitor diaper changes to detect health issues early
- Log sleep patterns to identify routines and optimize rest
- Share tracking data with partner and pediatrician
- Reduce mental load by having a single source of truth

## Pain Points

- Exhausted and sleep-deprived, needs quick data entry
- Forgets details when asked by doctor ("When was the last feeding?")
- Struggles to coordinate care information with partner
- Overwhelmed by apps with too many features

## Behaviors

## Scenarios

1. **Middle-of-night feeding:** Logs feeding time and duration with minimal interaction while half-asleep
2. **Pediatrician visit:** Pulls up weekly summary to answer questions about feeding frequency and diaper output
3. **Returning to work:** Sets up caretaker access so nanny can continue logging during the day
